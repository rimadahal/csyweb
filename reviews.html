    	<p1> Sublime Text </p1> 
    	<p2> For the code editing in web design and development, Sublime Text is the right tool. As compared to the standard text editor, sublime text is much faster and is easier to use so sublime is one of the best code editors fot its stability and speed. Sublime can be downloaded for free and it has a portable version which can be easily run from a USB stick. Sublime has a feature of colouring the code elements, it displays several color themes which helps in knowing the errors in realtime. Sublime has a unique feature of using several cursors at once so  if we need to change one variable in the whole file then we can select all the instances and edit them at once. So, these are the features that differentiate sublime from other code editors.</p2> <!-- A paragraph is written about the image -->
